Hello everyone (if someone's there). This project, **[RAG over Excel with IBM Dockling and Llama 3.2](https://github.com/piktx/excel-rag)**, was made to help you extract details from an **Excel** file using some of the best technologies that IBM and Meta made, namely, respectively, **Docling** and **Llama 3.2 Model** on your own computer. 

For more information on the workings of this project and how to run this program on your local machine, read this **[blog](https://pktx.xyz/posts/rag-over-excel)**
